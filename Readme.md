Knight Bot Mini is a WhatsApp MD bot built on top of the **Baileys** library.  
It's designed to be fast, lightweight, and easy to customize without touching the core code.  
This project is **fully open source** — you can modify it, rebrand it, and make your **own bot** from this codebase **free of cost**, without needing any permission from our side.  
All commands and the overall structure are written in a way that makes customization (bot image, prefix, name, features, etc.) as easy as possible.

## ✨ Features

- **Fully Open Source** – entire codebase is editable; host it anywhere (Heroku, panel, VPS, etc.).  
- **Easy Customization via Commands** – change **bot image**, **prefix**, **channel/newsletter**, **bot name**, etc. with simple commands.  
- **Modular Command System** – commands are organized in the `commands` folder for easy editing.  
- **Optimized for Stability** – RAM‑optimized media handling (streaming, temp cleanup), better session handling via `sessionID` in `config.js`.  
- **Owner Utilities** – restart, update from ZIP, and more owner‑only tools.

> This creates your own copy of `Knightbot-MD` under your GitHub account.

### 2. Get Pair Code

Deploy a small helper to generate a **pair code** and obtain your session string.

</a>

</div>

After scanning, you will receive a **session string** starting with:

```text
KnightBot!H4....
```

Copy that full string and paste it into `config.js`:

```js
sessionID: 'KnightBot!H4.....'
```

Or set it via the `SESSION_ID` environment variable when hosting.

### 3. Deploy on Panel (Katabump, etc.)

## 🛠 Local Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mruniquehacker/Knightbot-MD.git
cd Knightbot-MD
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash

### 3️⃣ Configure session

Edit `config.js`:

- **Option A: Use session string**

  ```js
  sessionID: 'KnightBot!H4.....'
  ```

- **Option B: Scan QR**

  ```js
  sessionID: ''
  ```

  Run the bot and scan the QR from the terminal.

### 4️⃣ Run the bot
